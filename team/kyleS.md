Hello, world. My name is Kyle Stanfield, and I enjoy programming in C++, using linux, and learning math. In my free time I enjoy going on climbing trips to Joshua Tree, hiking in the mountains, and playing the guitar.

I look forward to working on an FM synthesizer with my team, and I hope that we will be able to have our synth work as a VST plugin. It will also be engaging to work on a variety of effects and presets for the synth.
