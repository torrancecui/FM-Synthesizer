Demonstrator: Jack, 
Scribe : Kyle G, 
Reviewer : Torrance, 
Review Scribe : Tom

### Notes
Polyphony framework has been setup by Jack with wrapper classes. Basic polyphony is now working.
Todo: Implement square(Torrance) and sawtooth(Tom) waves for the synth.

For the MVP, we're not going to go all the way to FM, just a poly synth. FM will be worked on
afterwards.

Need to record all the JUCE project settings we're using somewhere. IE the checkboxes "plugin does X".
