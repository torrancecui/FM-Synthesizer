# Jack Kilgore - Ideas for fmSynthesizer

* I would like to eventually get this working as plugin. Firstly for the open-source, virtual modular program, VCV Rack. If possible I would like to get it working as a VST using JUCE or some other framework.

* Possibly use MAT's audio-visual framework, allolib. This will be nice for getting the first standalone app done. 

* Being able to feedback the carrier and modulating signals back into themselves would be idea. 

* Maybe allow arbitrary wavetables as well.


# A Little About Myself 

* I am highly motivated to build digital audio synthesizers. 

* I have built synthesizers in the past with C++ and Supercollider. 

* I have performed using these synthesizers live. 

* I like to hike and walk around the beach after the sun has set.
