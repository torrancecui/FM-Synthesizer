## Notes from Lab02 Meeting 

We need to make a minimum viable product within the next two weeks, so we should focus on having at least one voice, the ability to change the frequencies, and a volume slider, as well as MIDI output.

Follow the JUCE Audio Plugin tutorial until we get up to producing sound, then we can convene and compare code. At that point it will be easier to divy up tasks among our group members. We will split our groups into pairs, to prevent people from getting totally lost.
