# Hi, I'm Kyle.

I'm a second year CS major and in my free time I love playing around in DAWs such as Ableton Live and messing around with sounds. I've played around with software synths a bit so I'm familiar with the concept of FM and other types of synthesis, just not so much the math-y side of it so this will still be a learning opportunity for me

I think it'd be cool if our end result was a VST with a clean interface so that we could import it into other DAWs and apply effects onto it.
